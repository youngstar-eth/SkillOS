# x402 Launch Tweet — Draft

> **Note:** Drafted pre-rebrand (April–May 2026). The brand was "Skillbase" at this date. Project rebranded to "SkillOS" starting 2026-05-08. Historical content preserved verbatim for audit-trail integrity.

For the `@skillbase_games` announcement when we flip the switch on
public availability of the six x402 endpoints.

## Primary tweet (280 chars)

> Skillbase is live on @x402foundation.
>
> Six production endpoints. USDC on Base Sepolia via the @base + @coinbasedev CDP facilitator. Agents pay per call, retrieve verified gaming-decision data + AI Coach inference. No accounts, no API keys, no handshake.
>
> ↓ docs + live tx hashes

## Reply in thread — endpoints breakdown

> The six routes:
>
> • sp-tier-distribution — aggregate skill histogram, $0.01
> • decision-sample (4 tier-filtered) — verified human traces, $0.01–$0.10
> • coach-sample — live Claude Haiku inference, $0.05
>
> All discoverable via the x402 Bazaar.

## Reply in thread — architecture

> How it works:
>
> 1. Agent GETs endpoint → 402 + signed payment-required envelope
> 2. Agent signs EIP-3009 `transferWithAuthorization` on USDC
> 3. Retry with x-payment header → CDP facilitator verifies + settles on-chain
> 4. Response + x-payment-response header with tx hash
>
> Settlement before payload, always.

> Full docs + the test agent script (signs real payments, walks all 6 routes):

> First production x402 deployment in skill gaming.
